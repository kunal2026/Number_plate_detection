# NumberPlate_detection documentation 

## overview

This project aims to detect and recognize number plates in images using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. The system can be useful for various applications, such as traffic surveillance, toll collection, and parking management.

## Requirements

Ensure you do have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (opencv-python)

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## How this works?
1. Clone the repository or download the `nplatedetection.py' file.
2. Run the 'nplatedetection.py' file
3. your webcam will start processing to capture the real time image
4. The system will process the live video clips, detect number plates, and save the results in the "main" folder.
5. Detected faces will be highlighted with rectangles drawn around them.
6. Press 'q' to stop and exit the program


## Acknowledgments
- open source community for providing valuable resources and libraries
- The face detection functionality is implemented using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier provided by OpenCV
